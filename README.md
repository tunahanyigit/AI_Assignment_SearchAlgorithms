# AI_Assignment_SearchAlgorithms
In this assignment an agent created to solve the 8-puzzle game.
Implemented and compared several search algorithms and collected some statistics related to their performances. 

#Book
Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach - Third Edition has been taken as reference.

#Part-1
First part is to implement the iterative-deepening search algorithm. To do that iterativeDS and recursiveDepthLimitedSearch
functions implemented. Other functions provided for implementing the 8-puzzle agent.

#Part-2
Second part of the assignment, implement the A* search algorithm. aStarSearch and heuristic functions implemented.
Like the first part, Other functions provided for implementing the 8-puzzle agent.
